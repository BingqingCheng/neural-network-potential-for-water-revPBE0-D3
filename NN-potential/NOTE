This NN potential was fitted using the data in the folder /training-set/ 

I fitted the NNP using the parameters specified in input.nn using the code RuNNer.

One can run MD simulations with the NNP by:

1. Download the neural network potential code N2P2 from 
https://github.com/CompPhysVienna/n2p2

2. Install the lammps NNP pairstyle as instructed

3. Run MD simulations using the sample input files in the folder ./MD-sample/. You need to copy all the files specify the NNP into that folder.
